						<p>Maria is currently Global Outreach Coordinator for the SENS Research Foundation (https://www.sens.org/about-us/staff/) co-founded by Dr. Aubrey de Grey. She’s been part of SRF since its founding days and before that, part of Methuselah Foundation (co-founded by Dave Gobel and Aubrey de Grey). 
							<p>She is also a science and technology communicator and one of the leading voices in the field of Longevity. Her passion and strong involvement in science and technology, combined with her skills in Public Relations and networking, positioned her as one of the main "connectors" in the field, in charge of building new critical relationships, spreading the word about the mission and driving donations. She is also a singer, actress, composer, journalist and pilot. </p>
							<p>Maria is a radical-change believer and spends her multifaceted life working on facilitating disruptive change to help the world. You can find her giving a scientific talk, singing live for thousands of people, composing and acting for a Hollywood film, doing music journalism, or flying an airplane -but her main goal in life is to make sure one day aging doesn't mean to get sick. </p>
							<p>She is the co-founder of Longevity Bridge, dedicated to developing resources for optimal health - currently developing new assays to measure important biomarkers of aging.</p>
							<p>Maria also sits on the Boards of the Coalition for Radical Life Extension, California Transhumanist Party and Lifeboat Foundation. She is also a member of The Three Hundred.</p>
							<p>Maria is happily married to Gary Abramson.</p>
