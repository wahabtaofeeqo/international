			<b>1.</b> Why donate to the ILA?
			<br/>

If you want to best financially contribute for long and healthy lives we believe that you are at the right place:
	<br/>
<b>1.1.</b>  Fiscal advantages
<br/>
After one year of investigation for the best financing structure, the ILA fund was registered as a not-for-profit "fonds de dotation" dedicated to research towards improving lives: a specific structure in France that allows worldwide optimal fiscal advantages for donations. As indicated when donating below, depending on the country you live in, instead of donating to ILA directly you can donate to an ILA branch to have tax deductions. Also regarding Paypal donations, Paypal has accepted to use apply fees for ILA donations. We are taking action to continuously increase such advantages in order to attract worldwide donations for life-saving research. Would you represent an official, not-for-profit structure from another country whose goal is aligned with the ILA, or would you like to suggest some other advantage and try to implement it, please contact us at info@longevityalliance.org
<br/>

<b>1.2</b>  Use of funds
<br/>
In order to maximally reduce bias in the use of the money, persons from the ILA board can not be paid directly or indirectly and the administration is very strict in that regards as well as in using the fund according to the goals of the ILA, the ILA board uses collegial voting mechanisms and the board has a replacement mechanism that avoids opportunistic newcomers. In order to keep track towards the fundamental goals of the ILA a Manifesto has been written that is designed to last. In order for this secure system to still represent the will of donators you are below requested to indicate what you would ideally like you money to be used for and we will attempt on this page to be particularly precise on how the funds are used so that a 'pressure of the crowd' aligns views and usage.

				The ILA success stories speak for themselves:
				<ul class="unordered-list">
					<li>
						<span>Since 2013, longevity groups affiliated or connected with the ILA appear in over 50 countries, with thousands of online supporters.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>In October 2013, <a href="#">Longevity Events</a> are organized in more than 30 countries.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Since 2013 to the present, every October, the ILA leads the global campaign in support of aging and longevity research – first called the “International Longevity Day” (October 1) which later expanded to the <a href="#">“International Longevity Month”</a> during the entire month of October. This traditional campaign has combined the activities of many organizations and individual activists working to promote research, development and application for healthy longevity around the world. During the years, hundreds of events, publications and other promotional actions were organized in dozens of countries in the framework of this campaign. These activities help build up the longevity activism into a massive global grassroots movement.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>In October 2014, the ILA chooses a symbol: sparklers. The <a href="#">LightSpan"</a> campaign is run, dedicated to focus public attention on aging as a healthcare problem.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Since 2014 through 2016, the fundraising campaign for the ILA scientific project <a href="#">Major Mouse Testing Program (MMTP)</a> is conducted to gather resources for large geroprotectors testing program in mice.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>In 2015 the ILA initiates a number of events, dedicated to support the development of longevity technologies, and takes part in public discussion of the <a href="#">WHO Global Strategy and Action Plan on Aging.</a> </span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>In 2017, ILA is one of the leading organizations in the global campaign to include <a href="#">healthy aging and longevity into the 13th WHO work program for 2019-2023. The campaign was successful and the issue of healthy aging was for the first time included in the WHO work program thanks to longevity activism.</a></span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>In 2018, the ILA makes yet another impact on global health policy. Largely thanks to the efforts of ILA experts and advocates, <a href="#">aging is included as a modifier into the WHO’s International Classification of Diseases ICD-11 system</a>, which may encourage investment and focus for addressing aging-related ill health.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>ILA also advances policies in support of healthy longevity at the national level. Thus, in 2019, an ILA federated member – the Israeli Longevity Alliance – was instrumental for introducing the topic of “Research, Development and Education for the Promotion of Healthy Longevity and Prevention of Aging-related Diseases” into the <a href="#">Israel National Masterplan on Aging.</a></span>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="sample-text">
				With your support, the ILA will continue to advance longevity advocacy around the world, at both the grass roots and high level, to achieve the goal of <b>healthy longevity for all through scientific research!</b>
